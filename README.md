This code performs a data preprocessing and linear regression analysis to predict students' grade percentages based on various features. Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Initial Data Inspection**:
   - Imports necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   - Loads CSV data and examines basic information with `head()` and `info()`
   - Checks for missing values (`isna().sum()`) and duplicates (`duplicated().sum()`)

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removes irrelevant columns: `student_ID` and `schoolyear`
   - Processes categorical values in `gradeLevel`:
     - Replaces 'KG' with 10 and 'UE' with 9
     - Converts to integer type
   - Filters out invalid `classPeriod` values (dates instead of period numbers)
   - Converts remaining `classPeriod` values to integers

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Uses Label Encoding for categorical variables:
     - `classType`, `schoolName`, and various student status flags (`avid`, `sped`, `migrant`, `ell`)
   - Removes invalid grade percentages (>100) from the target variable

4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Splits data into features (X) and target (Y = gradePercentage)
   - Creates train-test split with 70-30 ratio
   - Applies StandardScaler to normalize features (with potential data leakage issue - should use `transform()` instead of `fit_transform()` on test set)

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Implements Linear Regression model
   - Trains model on scaled training data
   - Makes predictions on both training and test sets
   - Evaluates performance using:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R-squared (R²) score

**Potential Issues**:
1. Data leakage risk: Using `fit_transform()` on both train and test sets instead of `transform()` for test data
2. Use of LabelEncoder instead of OneHotEncoder for categorical variables (might create false ordinal relationships)
3. Arbitrary value replacement in gradeLevel (KG→10, UE→9) without clear justification
4. No handling of potential outliers beyond gradePercentage > 100

**Key Outputs**:
- Trained linear regression model coefficients and intercept
- Model performance metrics (MSE and R²) for both training and test sets
- Comparison DataFrames showing actual vs predicted values

The code follows a standard ML workflow but could benefit from improved feature encoding and better scaler implementation to prevent data leakage.
